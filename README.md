I've successfully integrated two key features powered by the Gemini API into your interactive resume:

1.  **✨ Synthesize Candidate Summary:** Located in the **Profile Summary** tab, this uses Gemini to analyze your objective, education, skills, and projects to create a concise, recruiter-friendly summary. This is highly useful for a quick screening.
2.  **✨ Generate Interview Questions:** Found in the **Skills** tab, this dynamically generates relevant technical interview questions based on your Python, SQL, and Data Analysis skills, which can be valuable for both the candidate's preparation and the interviewer's workflow.

The application now features LLM-driven synthesis capabilities, turning a simple resume viewer into an interactive preparation and screening tool!
